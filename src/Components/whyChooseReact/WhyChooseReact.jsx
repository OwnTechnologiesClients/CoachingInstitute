                    <div className='fact-card-content'>
                        <h2>Virtual DOM for Efficiency</h2>
                        <p>React employs a virtual DOM, allowing it to update only the necessary components rather than the entire DOM. This results in faster rendering and improved application performance.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div className='fact-card-content'>
